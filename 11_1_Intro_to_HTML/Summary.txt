In these Intro to HTML exercises, I learned some of the basic elements and syntax to create a simple HTML webpage. I used these skills to create a webpage for puggles, a webpage about Chelsea FC player Eden Hazard (with links to external sites for more information and an embedded YouTube video), a webpage to display a table showing the quarterly regional sales for a small salesforce, and a webpage to dispaly graphs/images that were created in a previous activity. 

While working through these exercises, it became clear that a lot can be done with simple HTML code. Though they do not have any CSS styling or interactivity besides clickable links (and though the pages look like thy were created in the 1990s), they work. From there, I know I can tweak things, add elements, add CSS styling and have a good-looking webpage, but I'll hold off on that for now, since that's in a later section of class.
